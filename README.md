# Projects

The repository contains the following:

1) Sentiment analysis on tweets (Python):
This project aims to reveal the variety and power balance of the main US conservative factions. We first conduct a clout and vulnerability matrix analysis to identify the main spheres of influence within the Party. We then focus in more detail on the sensibility of these politicians with respect to 3 major political topics of Trump’s era – social issues, environmental cause and openness to the world – through positioning mapping. Finally, we proceed to a sentiment analysis.

2) Time series analysis (R):
The aim of this analysis is to better understand what drives the evolution of the heart rate during a bike ride. We employed a dataset composed of 45 tracks. In the first part, we conduct a univariate analysis of the heart rate, namely a Hidden Markov Model. In the second part, we built a Dynamic Linear Model by including speed and elevation in the regression framework.

3) Regression analysis on Mental Health: decreasing income as a risk factor for mental health disorders (Python):
The global economic recession, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, raised concerns about the impact of decreasing income as a risk factor for mental health disorders such as depression. However, the literature does not provide a clear-cut answer. Using micro-level cross-country data from Europe, we estimate an Ordered Logit model to provide evidence on the matter.
